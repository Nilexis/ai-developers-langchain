# Refactoring Copied Markdown Files

When you encounter a Markdown (.md) file that contains copied or pasted text, follow these steps to refactor it into a clean, well-formatted Markdown file:

1. **Remove Unnecessary Artifacts:**
   - Delete any UI elements, buttons (e.g., 'Copy', 'Edit'), or unrelated instructions that were copied from other sources.
   - Remove duplicate or irrelevant lines.

2. **Structure Content Clearly:**
   - Use appropriate Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to organize sections and subsections.
   - Add bullet points, numbered lists, or tables where it improves clarity.
   - Ensure consistent spacing between sections.

3. **Format Text Properly:**
   - Use bold, italics, or inline code formatting where relevant.
   - Ensure all code blocks are properly fenced with triple backticks and specify the language if needed.
   - Fix any broken or inconsistent line breaks.

4. **Language and Clarity:**
   - Edit for concise, clear language.
   - Correct any spelling or grammar mistakes.

5. **Metadata:**
   - Remove any metadata or comments that are not part of the intended content.

6. **References:**
   - If the file includes references or sources, format them as a proper Markdown list or section.
